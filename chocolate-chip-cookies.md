0. preheat the oven to 400 degrees
1. put the the sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla into a mixing bowl
2. whisk it together until it is creamy and smooth
3. turn the oatmeal into a fine flour using a blender
4. add all the dry ingredients into the mixing bowl
5. stir it together until the ingredients are just mixed
6. mix in chocolate chip cookies (i like the "super" size ones)
7. make little cookie dough balls about the size of a golfball
8. bake for about 9 minutes
9. enjoy!

> every oven is different so you may need to adjust the time or temperature
slightly. in my experience 9 minutes makes the best cookies so i would aim
for adjusting the temperature until they cook correctly in 9 minutes. when you
take them out of the oven they should look as if they are not quite finished.
they will be slightly soft inside - taking them off the baking sheet with a
spatula should not be easy, but not difficult either. after they cool they will
look perfect the way cookies should.
